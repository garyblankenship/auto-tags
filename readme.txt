Automatically add relevant tags to new posts.
== Description ==
This plugin uses the yahoo.com API to find the most relevant keywords from the content of your post, and then adds them as tags.

The tagging is **fully automatic**, so if you're using a plugin like feedwordpress to display RSS feeds on your blog as posts, everything will get done as the feed posts are published. **No user intervention necessary!**

== Installation ==


1. Upload the auto-tag directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Open the Auto Tags/Settings menu to configure.
4. That's it. Every new post will now be automatically tagged.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the configuration options ? =

There are quite a few, but you can choose whether to tag posts or pages or both, the maximum number of tags on each post, and more!

= Wow, is this great or what? =

Yes, but thanks for saying so in the form of a question!

== Screenshots ==
